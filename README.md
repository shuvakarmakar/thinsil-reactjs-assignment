## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuvakarmakar/thinsil-reactjs-assignment.git

2. cd ecommerce-website-pollux
3. npm install
4. Create .env.local in the root of the project folder

            VITE_apiKey="AIzaSyDrlQBPmQBQvjrhOG6p9rghZdtLBagrbXw"
            VITE_authDomain="ecommerce-pollux.firebaseapp.com"
